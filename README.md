# Random Directory Deletion

This is a simple Node.js script that randomly deletes a specified directory.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhaydubey200/Directory-deleted.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd directory-deleted
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Modify the `index.js` file to specify the directory you want to potentially delete.

5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Note

- **CAUTION**: This script deletes directories randomly. Ensure that you understand the consequences before running it.
- Modify the `directoryPath` variable in `index.js` to specify the directory you want to potentially delete.
- The deletion occurs with a probability of approximately 1/6.

Feel free to customize it further based on your preferences or additional information you want to provide about the project.
